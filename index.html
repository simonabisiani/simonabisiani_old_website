	<h2 id = 'decription'>(Online|Data|Science) journalist</h2>

	<p>Hi, I'm Gianna! I built and currently run <a href='https://www.dw.com/data' target='_blank'>DW Data</a>, the data journalism unit at DW. As a dedicated online journalist I'm passionate about the multimedia storytelling opportunities the web offers. If you don't find me raving about this, I'm producing cool data visualizations and insightful data-driven stories and spread enthusiasm for data journalism as a ddj trainer.</p>

	<p>I enjoy building things: Both, online – using code to create data visualizations and applications – as well as offline – using my project management skills to craft workflows and teams (or my actual hands for woodworking). Trained as a biologist, I combine analytical thinking with my journalistic curiousity to actually do what I thrive at: Constantly learning new things.</p>

	<p>Scroll on to see a selection of <a href='#projects'>projects</a> I've realized. In the <a href='#about'>about-section</a> you can learn more about me and my skills.</p>

		<h5>With an international audience: Regionalization through data</h5>
		<p>This project on the prospects receiving a long-term visa for Germany perfectly utilized the power of data journalism, allowing to fit a story to specific regional contexts to cater the needs of an internationally operating media company. On the backstory-side: Part of my job is to broaden the variety of chart types covered by our style guide and establish standards for them. This piece added two at once: swarmplots and marimekko charts.</p>

		<h5>'But it doesn't look fancy' or: The power of simplicity</h5>
		<p>What are the priorities of EU migration policy? Employment opportunities is just one cause the EU dedicates its money to. Equally important: Closing the last open routes to Europe. This piece is a good showcase for how you can tell a compelling story with yet simple visualizations. From a storytelling perspective it shows another advantage of data journalism: To hold the powerful accountable with fact-based arguments.</p>

		<h5>Workflows for interactives</h5>
		<p>With our team founded in June 2017, I produced this story ahead of the German elections. From idea to final product, it took four weeks and helped establish how existing workflows need to be improved to sustainably produce data-driven interactives regularly. With every project I aim to broaden my skill set: Since this one you can wake me up in the middle of the night to ask for Regex commands. I am also forever grateful to the people who invented Python's OCR library tesseract.</p>

	<h2>About me</h2>

	<p>Since June 2017, I'm the Head of the Data Journalism team at Deutsche Welle (DW), Germany's international broadcaster. Previously I worked for the interactive background magazine <a href='https://www.derkontext.com' target="_blank">Der Kontext</a>, where I explored non-linear storytelling. Before that, I was a multimedia editor for environmental topics at <a href='https://www.dw.com/globalideas' target="_blank">DW Global Ideas</a>. The position I learnt most in was being the Head of Online at <a href ='https://www.dw.com/lifelinks' target='_blank'>Life Links</a>, transmedia magazine I co-built from scratch.</p>
